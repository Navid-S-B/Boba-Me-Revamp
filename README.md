# Boba Me Revamp
Boba Me wasa concept initialised during my SENG2021 course, which in biref, was an application which aims to connect both the Boba Tea Industry to western audiences much more effectively than conventionally done. Although during the course of the original project, it was not executed successfully, especially in terms of the Frontend. However, there were also failures with utilising the latest cloud computing technologies, and properly implementing DevOps practices within the project.

The original project did utilise on creating a cloud based application utilising AWS EC2, Nginx, Flask, React and AWS RDS PostgreSQL, however it was not built to be cloud native, nor truly scalable. Also with the direction of application development, now shifting to a DevOps ideology, with DevOps Engineers specificially needing to understand all aspects of development from deveolopment of frontend and backend technologies to IT operations such as maintaining infrastructure, this project is essentially going to be the show case for that, from bottom up to truly show the scope of Boba Me.

This entire respository consists of updated documentation for the UX/UI, API, testing pipelines and deployment pipelines.

# What is Boba Me?
Boba Me is an application which at first, aims to connect western consumers with the Boba Tea industry, as current data only suggests that Boba Tea is mostly reaching Asian consumers living in the west. The current marketing strategies fail to adapt the drink to create major interest from western consumers to try the becoming rapidly popular drink internationally. The market is currently valued at $3 billion dollars according to CNN internationally in markets in Asia and the US, showing the possibility of new market growth and possibly expanding the product to meet more western consumers.

Hence the application attempts to address this issue, by creating an open market platform, where Boba Tea shops and industry can invest to educate western consumers and directly market to them the concept of Boba Me. Features of this application, will mainly become another avenue to collect generalised data across the entire market, to help industry understand the interests of western consumers, and overall sales trends with their competitors. This application, also provides the general consumer with varying interests in the product to gain benefits such as discounts, possible drink combinations, shop information, drink information and many more!

# Project Details
## Deprecated Project 
This is the old version of the project, which is credited to my previous collaborators, and form the old base and foundation of the project to build on top of.
Check out https://github.com/SENG2021-Boba-Engineers/Project

## Current Project
There are two folders:
- Sourcecode
    - Contains all of the frontend and backend sourcecode with minimal documentation to summarise each component
- Documentation
    - Contains detailed overview of all technologies used and design choices made.

I hope you all enjoy :).
